# Particle-effect-background
Hey everyone. I have been working on a Javascript particle effect background. It's nothing more than just a little project I decided to work on as I teach myself web development, and thought it would be cool to have an animated background. 
I am having an issue with it not loading, and I can't tell if I have done the JS wrong or just not linked it correctly. I figured I would post it here so you can all have a look. If anyone figures out what the issue is could you please let me know, thank you.
